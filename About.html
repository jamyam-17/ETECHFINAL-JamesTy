                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p> Ty-torial is a tutoring business dedicated to helping students from Grades 1-10, Senior Highschool Students, and even College students. We are fully aware that students have difficulties in learning in their own schools or at their own pace. Each student has their own preferred learning style or technique, and it is our job to meet these needs to make learning much more internalized rather than memorized. Our tutors are equipped with the best knowledge for each subject, they are also trained to adjust and adapt to the student's needs since they are properly trained to handle each student they would encounter, they are highly skilled in their own expertise and teaching methods to make their students love learning. At Ty-Torial we believe that each student is a genius and it is our job to unlock and unleash their full academic potential. Join now and be a member to be a part of the process of genius-making! </p>

    <h1>Our Goals</h1>
    <p>Ty-torial aims meet the learning needs of our students with our materials and expertise on each field. Our goal is to provide a supportive community of teacher-to-student relationships where we build trust and support to build an engaging, accomodating, inclusive, and inspiring  learning environment. Ty-torial does not only specifically teach for their students to attain a higher grade, but to inspire them and emphasize the beauty of education, welcoming them to the body of knowledge the world has. We also aim to improve our student's self-esteem so they could study independently and confidently in the future.
